# Northwestern University: Surmeier Lab

This will be the primary repository for python code written for electrophysiology and imaging data analysis used by the Surmeier lab. If all goes according to plan, this repository will primarily be for code that our lab is just playing around with. I hope to have a core repository specifically for fully developed code and separate repositories will contain all the unique code for used in individual published papers.

Note: it's not like the people writing this code are software developers, so please understand it's probably not completely functional/documented/whatever.
